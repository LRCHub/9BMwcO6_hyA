# Bon Jovi – Always

```
This romeo is bleeding
but you can't see his blood
It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog kicked up
It's been raining since you left
me
Now I'm drowning in the flood
You see I've  always
Been a fighter
But without you a give up
Now I can sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
Well I guess I'm not that
Good anymore
But baby that's just me
And I will love you
Baby always
And I'll be there
Forever and a day always
I'll be there
'till the stars don't shine
'Till the heavens burst
and the words don't rhyme
And I know when I die
you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you always
Now the pictures
that you left behind
Are just memories
of a different life
Some that made us laugh
some that made us cry
One that made you
have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers
through you hair
To touch your lips
to hold you near
When you say your prayers
try to understand
I've made mistakes
I'm just a man
When he holds you close
when he pulls you near
When he says the words
you've been needing to hear
I wish I was him
with these words of mine
To save you
'till the end of time
And I will love you
baby always
And I'll be there
forever and a day always
If you told me to cry for you
I could
If you told me to die for you
I would
Take a look at my face
there's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you
Well there ain't no luck
in these loaded dice
So baby if you give me
just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams
and our old lives
And find a place
where the sun still shine
And I will love you
baby always
And I'll be there
forever and a day always
I'll be there
'till the stars don't shine
'Till the heavens burst
and the words don't rhyme
And I know when I die
you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you always
always
